# dotfiles
Various dot-files.

Structured to use [```stow```](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to handle symbolic links and inspired by [Alex Pearce](https://alexpearce.me/2016/02/managing-dotfiles-with-stow/) way of handling ```stow``` and dot-files.

## Usage example
```shell
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/eric1980/dotfiles.git .dotfiles
cd .dotfiles
stow fish
```
